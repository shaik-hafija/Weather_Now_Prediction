I developed Weather Now to address Jamie's requirement of quickly accessing real-time weather conditions for any city. By leveraging the OpenWeather API, which offers extensive weather-related content, I ensured the app meets the needs of outdoor enthusiasts like Jamie. Users can search for any city or use their current location to fetch weather details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions. I also integrated features like sunrise and sunset times and a 5-day forecast for better planning. 

The app is built with React, styled with responsive CSS, and includes robust error handling for invalid city names or geolocation issues. The choice of the OpenWeather API was intentional, as it provides comprehensive, reliable weather data that perfectly aligns with Jamie's needs. Weather Now delivers a seamless, interactive experience for users, ensuring they have all the information required to plan their outdoor activities with confidence and ease.
